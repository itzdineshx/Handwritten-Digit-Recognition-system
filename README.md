## Overview

The **Handwritten Digit Recognition Web App** is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to draw a digit on a canvas and instantly see its prediction. Using a CNN model trained on the MNIST dataset, the app can classify digits from 0 to 9 with high accuracy. This project is ideal for demonstrating the potential of deep learning in handwriting recognition.

## Features

- **Real-Time Drawing Canvas**: Users can freely draw any digit (0-9) on an interactive canvas.
- **Instant Predictions**: Upon clicking "Predict," the app identifies the digit and displays the result along with a confidence score.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, responsive design with step-by-step instructions to guide users.
- **Accurate Predictions**: Leveraging a trained CNN model for reliable and accurate digit recognition.

## Demo

You can try the app by following the setup instructions below or check out a live demo if available.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for backend and model integration.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For creating and training the CNN model.
- **Flask**: Lightweight framework to build the backend of the web application.
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS**: For creating an interactive and responsive frontend.
- **NumPy and Pillow**: For handling image preprocessing and manipulation.

## How It Works

The web app consists of a simple workflow:
1. **Draw a Digit**: The user draws a digit (0-9) on the canvas using their mouse or touch input.
2. **Preprocess Input**: The drawn image is resized and preprocessed to match the input dimensions required by the CNN model.
3. **Predict Digit**: The preprocessed image is passed to the CNN model, which predicts the digit and returns the result along with a confidence score.
4. **Display Result**: The predicted digit and confidence score are displayed, giving users immediate feedback.

### Model Architecture
The CNN model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 images of handwritten digits. It includes layers such as:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features like edges and textures.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial size and computation, making the model translation-invariant.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Analyze high-level features for classification.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or above
- Git for cloning the repository
- Virtual environment setup (recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
    cd handwritten-digit-recognition
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # For Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Flask app**:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. **Access the application**:
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to start using the app.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Draw a Digit**: On the canvas, use your mouse or finger to draw a digit from 0 to 9.
2. **Click "Predict"**: Once you are finished, press the "Predict" button.
3. **View Prediction**: The predicted digit and confidence level will appear on the screen.

## Future Applications

The core technology behind this project – digit recognition with CNNs – can be adapted for numerous real-world applications, including but not limited to:

- **Form Processing**: Automating data extraction from handwritten forms in finance, healthcare, and education.
- **Postal and Logistics Automation**: Identifying ZIP codes and addresses for faster mail sorting and delivery.
- **Banking Automation**: Digitally reading and processing handwritten checks, deposit slips, and forms.
- **Educational Tools**: Assisting in automated grading and digital input for tests and assignments.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Using real-time digit recognition on smartphones for expense tracking, educational apps, and more.
